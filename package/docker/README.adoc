= Docker IPT

A Docker image for the https://www.gbif.org/ipt[GBIF IPT].

The image builds upon the Docker community Tomcat 8.5 / OpenJDK 8 / Debian stable image.

We regularly publish IPT releases as Docker images to https://hub.docker.com/r/gbif/ipt/[Docker Hub].

== To run the Docker image

Refer to https://ipt.gbif.org/manual/en/ipt/2.5/installation#installation-using-docker[Installation using Docker] in the IPT User Manual.

== Upgrading

Note that, for better consistency with the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard], from version 2.4.0 the IPT's default data directory is `/srv/ipt`, *not* `/usr/local/ipt`.  This can be overridden, see the manual.

== To build and deploy the Docker image

(This process is for GBIF developers.)

. `docker build --pull --build-arg IPT_VERSION=2.5.0 -t gbif/ipt:2.5.0 .`
. *Test the resulting image!*
+
`docker run --volume /full/path/to/data-directory:/srv/ipt --publish 8080:8080 gbif/ipt:2.5.0`

. `docker push gbif/ipt:2.5.0` (stop here for a pre-release)
. `docker tag gbif/ipt:2.5.0 gbif/ipt:latest && docker push gbif/ipt:latest`
